# 🚀 Chrome UI Clone - React + Vanilla CSS

This is a lightweight clone of the Google Chrome browser UI built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Vanilla CSS**. The project focuses on replicating Chrome's visual layout including the tab bar, toolbar, and address bar, without using any CSS frameworks.

---

## 🔧 Features

- ⚛️ Built with React (using Vite for fast development)
- 🎨 Styled entirely with vanilla CSS (no Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.)
- 📁 Component-based structure for scalability
- 🧪 Easily extensible for testing, state management, or real tab functionality
